            <p class="sub-content script-mt">Never taught I could ever get this attached to a girl. But u proved me wrong. 
    I met u when I had everything, I never needed anything, but I never knew that 
        all I needed was you.
Your good mornings are the reason for my good mornings.
Your good nights make my day complete.
                Soo many miss understandings, yet u never left me.
                Once I lost u in the blue, but I was unable to get u back, but giving up is not an option anymore for me.
                I will wait for you like the star wait for the moon every night.
                I hurt u, yet u healed me.
                I am still holding on to the roses in the heavy wind hopping for you'r return.
                You were special for me on the Day 1 and will be for the rest of my life.
                Your whole presence makes me feel special.
                You are the reason that I still believe in friendship. 
                Your are my happy and incomplete dream of mine.
                As they say "Heart is in sorrow and the one causing it is in the heart".I am happy carry you in my heart.ðŸŒ¹ðŸ¤—
